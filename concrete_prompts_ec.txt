}

The class Logger contains the following attributes:
static inline size_t m_activeFunctions { 0 };
const string m_name { }
m_arguments { };

It also contains following methods:
Logger(const string& name,const string& arguments = ""s)
~Logger()

This c++ object has no parent relationship with other objects.
Please generate a detailed explanation document for this c++ component based on the code of the target object itself.

Please write out the function of this class in bold plain text, followed by a detailed analysis in plain text (including all details), in english to serve as the documentation for this part of the code.

The standard format which MUST be adhered is as follows:

**Summary**: The functionality of Logger is XXX. (Only code name and one sentence function description are required)
**attributes**: The attributes of this class.
* attribute1: XXX

The function Questions::ask contains the following parameters:
KnowledgeBase& kb
const string& variable


The parent c++ object of this object is Questions.
Please generate a detailed explanation document for this c++ component based on the code of the target object itself.

Please write out the function of this function in bold plain text, followed by a detailed analysis in plain text (including all details), in english to serve as the documentation for this part of the code.

The standard format which MUST be adhered is as follows:

**Summary**: The functionality of Questions::ask is XXX. (Only code name and one sentence function description are required)
**parameters**: The parameters of this function.
* parameter1: XXX
* parameter2: XXX
* ...


**Code Description**: The description of this function.
(Detailed and CERTAIN code analysis and description...And please include the reference relationship with its callers and callees in the project from a functional perspective: 
the callers include: KnowledgeBase::prove, KnowledgeBase::askValue 
the callees include KnowledgeBase::setVariable, KnowledgeBase::isLegalAnswer, toupper, KnowledgeBase::report, KnowledgeBase::outputLegalAnswers)
**Note**: Points to note about the use of the code
The return type of this object: bool

You are an AI documentation assistant, and your task is to generate c++ documentation based on the given code of an object. The purpose of the documentation is to help developers and beginners understand the function and specific usage of the code.

Now you need to generate a document for a function, whose name is "Rule::prove".

The content of the code is as follows:
bool Rule::prove(KnowledgeBase& kb,const string& variable) 
{
   Logger log("Rule::prove"s,variable);
   if (variable != m_variable)
   {
      return false;
   }
   for (const auto& condition : m_conditions)
   {
      string value { kb.getValue(condition.first) };
      if (value == ""s)
      {
         if (!kb.prove(condition.first) && !kb.askValue(condition.first))
         {
            return false;

         value = kb.getValue(condition.first);
