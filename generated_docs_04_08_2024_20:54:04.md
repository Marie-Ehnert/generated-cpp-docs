# class Logger 
**Summary**: The Logger class provides logging functionality by recording the name of a function along with its arguments.

**Attributes**: This class contains two private attributes that store information about a logged function.

* **m_activeFunctions**: A static inline size_t variable that keeps track of the number of active functions.
* **m_name**: A const string attribute that stores the name of the logged function.
* **m_arguments**: A const string attribute that stores the arguments of the logged function.

**Methods**: The Logger class has two public methods: a constructor and a destructor.

* **Logger(const string& name, const string& arguments = ""s)**: This constructor initializes an instance of the Logger class with a given function name and optional arguments. If the logging is active (determined by the constexpr condition), it prints the function name and arguments to the console.
* **~Logger()**: The destructor method is responsible for closing out the logged function. If logging is active, it prints the function name and arguments again, with a decreased indentation level.

**Code Description**: The Logger class provides a way to log information about functions in the program. It maintains an internal counter of the number of active functions and uses this information to determine the indentation level for printing function names and arguments. This allows for a clear view of the function call stack and helps with debugging purposes.

**Note**: The logging functionality is only activated when the constexpr condition `loggingActive` is true. Developers can control the activation state of logging through this condition.

**Code Description**: The inputVariableValue function is a member of the KnowledgeBase class. It takes three parameters: an istream object, and references to two string variables, which represent the input variable name and its corresponding value. The function reads user input from the provided stream and populates the `variable` and `value` strings accordingly.

The function consists of several steps:

1.  It first reads the input variable name using the `inputToken` function.
2.  If the input stream is empty, and the variable name is an empty string (`""s`), the function returns false, indicating that the input is invalid.
3.  Next, it calls the `inputIsAre` function to read and validate any additional "is/are" phrases that may be present in the input stream.
4.  If the "is/are" phrase is invalid or missing, the function returns false.
5.  Finally, it reads the input value using the `inputToken` function again.
6.  If the input stream is empty, and the value is an empty string (`""s`), the function returns false, indicating that the input is invalid.

The function ultimately returns true if all inputs are valid; otherwise, it returns false.

**Note**: This function relies on other KnowledgeBase class member functions, such as `inputToken` and `inputIsAre`, to perform specific tasks. The callers of this function include `KnowledgeBase::inputRule`.
***

***
# function main 
**Summary**: The main function initializes an input file stream and repeatedly prompts the user to enter a file name until a valid file is opened. It then processes the file contents using a KnowledgeBase object.

**Parameters**: None

**Code Description**: The main function begins by declaring an empty ifstream object, which represents the input file stream. A do-while loop is used to repeatedly prompt the user for a file name until a valid file is successfully opened. Within each iteration of the loop, the program prompts the user for a file name and attempts to open the corresponding file. If the file does not exist, the program asks the user if they wish to try again. The user's response is read using getline, and the response is converted to uppercase using toupper. The program continues to ask the user for input until they respond with "Y" to indicate they want to continue or "N" to indicate they do not.

Once a valid file has been opened, the function creates an instance of the KnowledgeBase class, which is assumed to contain knowledge and processing capabilities. The function then calls the input method on the KnowledgeBase object, passing in the open file stream as a parameter. If the input operation is successful, the function calls the run method on the KnowledgeBase object, indicating that the program has completed its primary task.

**Note**: The main function returns an integer value of 0 to indicate successful execution. The use of do-while loops and conditional statements enables the program to repeatedly prompt the user for input until a valid file is opened or the user decides to terminate the process.

**Code Description**: This function asks a series of questions to determine if the user's answer is acceptable. It iterates through a list of predefined questions and checks each one against the given variable. If the question matches the variable, it enters a loop where it repeatedly prompts the user for input until an acceptable answer is provided.

In this loop, it displays the current question, reads the user's response, converts it to uppercase, and then checks if the response is a legal answer according to the KnowledgeBase. If the response is valid, it updates the variable in the KnowledgeBase with the new answer and reports that the knowledge has been updated. If the response is not valid, it displays an error message and outputs the list of legal answers.

The function continues asking questions until a valid answer is provided, at which point it returns true to indicate success. If no valid answer is found after iterating through all the questions, it returns false.

**Note**: This function relies on other functions from the KnowledgeBase class, such as `setVariable`, `isLegalAnswer`, `report`, and `outputLegalAnswers`. It also uses the `toupper` function to convert user input to uppercase. The callers of this function include `KnowledgeBase::prove` and `KnowledgeBase::askValue`.

Return Type: bool

# method Rule::prove of Rule 
**Summary**: The **Rule::prove** function verifies whether a given rule is valid by checking its conditions against a knowledge base.

**Parameters**:

* `KnowledgeBase& kb`: A reference to a knowledge base object that stores and manages knowledge.
* `const string& variable`: A constant string representing the variable being evaluated in the rule.

**Code Description**: The **Rule::prove** function is responsible for validating whether a rule is true based on its conditions and the information stored in the provided knowledge base. This process involves several steps:

1. The function first checks if the input `variable` matches the internal `m_ variable` attribute of the rule object. If not, it returns `false`.
2. It then iterates through each condition stored in the `m_conditions` vector. For each condition, it retrieves the associated value from the knowledge base using `kb.getValue(condition.first)`.
3. If the retrieved value is an empty string (`""`), the function checks if the knowledge base can prove or provide the value for the given condition. If not, it returns `false`. Otherwise, it updates the value and reports that it is currently looking for the variable.
4. The function continues to check each condition against the retrieved values from the knowledge base. If any condition fails to match its expected value (`condition.second`), the function returns `false`.
5. Once all conditions have been verified, the function sets the internal `m_ active` attribute to `false`, indicating that the rule is no longer active.
6. Finally, it reports that the variable has been learned and updates the knowledge base with the learned value using `kb.setVariable(m_variable, m_value)`.

**Note**: The **Rule::prove** function relies on various methods from the `KnowledgeBase` class, including `setVariable`, `prove`, `askValue`, `getValue`, and `report`. A thorough understanding of these underlying functions is essential for effectively utilizing the **Rule::prove** method.
***
# method Rules::prove of Rules 
**Summary**: The Rules::prove function is used to prove the existence of a variable within a knowledge base by iterating through a set of rules and checking if any of them are active and applicable.

**Parameters**:

* `kb`: A reference to a KnowledgeBase object, which contains the rules and variables being searched.
* `variable`: A constant string representing the name of the variable to be found in the knowledge base.

**Code Description**: The Rules::prove function begins by logging its activity and reporting the current search target. It then iterates through each rule in the knowledge base, checking if it is active using the `isActive` method. If a rule is active, the function calls the `prove` method on that rule, passing the same knowledge base and variable as arguments. If any of these rules prove to be applicable, the function immediately returns `true`. If none of the rules are applicable after iterating through all of them, the function returns `false`.

**Note**: The Rules::prove function relies on the existence of a valid KnowledgeBase object being passed in, which contains the necessary rules and variables. The function also assumes that the `isActive` method is implemented correctly for each rule in the knowledge base.

As part of its functionality, this function calls the `report` method of the provided KnowledgeBase object to log information about its search progress.
